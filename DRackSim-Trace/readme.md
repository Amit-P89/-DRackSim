<h1>Trace-Based Simulations for Disaggregated Memory Systems</h1>

***Instructions on running simulations:***
* Download DRAMSim2 in this directory and apply DRAMSim2.patch on the extracted 'DRAMSim2' directory. 
```
patch -p1 < DRAMSim2.patch
```
* Make DRAMSim2
* Copy files in DRAMSim2_ini to ini directory in DRAMSim2/ini

***Running Trace-Based Simulation***
* Trace production and disaggregated memory simulation works independently in two steps.
* The traces are produced first using Pin and the tool inside directory Trace_tool
* Multiple traces can be collected representing multiple nodes and can be used to perform rack-scale disaggregated memory simulation
